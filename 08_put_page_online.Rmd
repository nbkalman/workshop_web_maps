# Put Your Web Page online

There are many options to put your web page online so others can see and interact with it. At the heart of the task is moving your *docs* folder to an online server and having some way to host the website. One option that is free of cost and well-documented is to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (see the instructions for a "project site").
